            <h2>Why 2000s Cars Are Gaining Value in 2025</h2>
            <p>The early 2000s marked a pivotal era in automotive design. Cars from this decade combined emerging technologies like traction control and early infotainment with driver-focused features like six-speed manuals and hydraulic steering. Unlike today’s screen-heavy vehicles, 2000s cars offered simplicity and reliability, making them easy to maintain and fun to drive.</p>
            <p>Today, collectors and enthusiasts are rediscovering these vehicles for their balance of performance, style, and affordability. Models with low production numbers, motorsport heritage, or cultural significance are seeing increased demand at auctions and private sales. For example, the <strong>Subaru Impreza WRX STI</strong> and <strong>Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution</strong> are prized for their rally roots, while the <strong>Toyota Prius</strong> set new standards for fuel efficiency.</p>
